## Documentation

## Features

- **Queueable Chain**: Eliminate the issues with "Too many queueable jobs" by using the `Async.queueable()` method to enqueue jobs in both synchronous and asynchronous context.
  - Framework will automatically handle the chaining of jobs, allowing you to enqueue multiple jobs without hitting the limit, in the same time using as many jobs as possible.
  - Each job will get its own Custom Job ID, which can be used to track the job status.
  - Async Result Custom Object will be created for each job, allowing you to track the status of each job.
  - Support for finalizers, which are executed after the job is processed, allowing you to handle any finalization logic.
  - Allows for manually adding jobs to chain
- **Schedulable Jobs**: Schedule jobs to run at specific times using the `Async.schedulable()` method.
  - Convert any `QueueableJob` or `Database.Batchable` into a schedulable job, by using the `asSchedulable()` method.
  - Support easier cron expressions using the `CronBuilder` class.
- **Batchable Jobs**: Execute batch jobs using the `Async.batchable()` method.
- **Custom Metadata Configuration**: Configure the QueueableJob settings using the `QueueableJobSettings__mdt` custom metadata type to enable or disable jobs, and to control the creation of Async Result records.
- **Custom Object for Async Results**: The `AsyncResult__c` custom object is created for each processed queueable job, allowing you to track the chained job status and details.
